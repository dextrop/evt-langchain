# Langchain Events

The project is made to provide automation using langchain and [nlp2fn](https://pypi.org/project/nlp2fn/0.0.1/). 

**about langchain and [nlp2fn](https://pypi.org/project/nlp2fn/0.0.1/)** 

- Langchain is a powerful Python library designed for blockchain-based language translation. It leverages advanced machine learning and natural language processing techniques to facilitate multi-language translations. By using blockchain technology, Langchain aims to ensure the accuracy and reliability of translations, fostering trust and quality. It also provides a decentralized framework for translators to contribute and earn from their efforts.
- nlp2fn, a seamless and intuitive software tool for Python automation. With the ability to load and read Python functions from any specified location, nlp2fn brings all your automation tasks together. Whether your functions reside in local directories or remote servers, nlp2fn fetches, loads, and prepares them for execution â€” as simple as a statement.

## Setup 

- **Clone**
```shell
git clone git@github.com:dextrop/evt-langchain.git
```

This will clone `git@github.com:dextrop/evt-langchain.git` to your local system  `evt-langchain`

- **Install Dependencies**
```shell
cd evt-langchain
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

- **Add Source**
```shell
nlp2fn set source events 
```
**make sure you are inside `evt-langchain` clone dirtectory before running the above command**

## Start using

Now when we have setup our source directory as events from evt-langchain we can start using different events.
A list of events are

#### 1. Chatbot 

To Run chatbot 

```shell
nlp2fn exec -m "Start using chatbot"
```

Follow the instruction provided by chatbot event.
